# Project Name: tower_defence.cpp

Tower_defence.cpp is a programming-themed tower defense game, with different programmers and programming tools as towers and bugs as enemies. The objective of the game is to defeat the bugs and survive through all the waves.
Each tower type has its own ability and the player can place towers strategically to fight against the waves of enemies. Every enemy that reaches the end of the map will deal a certain amount of damage to the player, if the player runs out of health, the game ends and the playerâ€™s score will be saved to the leaderboard.

You can find instructions how to build the application reading the Project Summary & Guide in the docs folder. Or if you prefer to just try the game, run the executable in the export folder. Have fun!
